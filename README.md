## _k_-means clustering
A vanilla implementation of the classic _k_-means clustering algorithm. 

Note: The algorithm is highly sensitive to the initialization of centroids. This implementation randomly chooses k points from the input data as centroids. This is certainly not a great heuristic, so please feel free to experiment with it.
